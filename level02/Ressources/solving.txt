We see a file .pcap
We use wireshark in kali for reading it
In line 43 we can read password
So we do follow tcp command => we have ft_wandr...NDRe.LOL
We see that we don t know what are the caracters . so we hexdump this and we see the . = 7F and 7F in ascii is the delete caractere
So ft_wandr...NDRe.LOL => ft_waNDReLOL
